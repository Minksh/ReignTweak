 **ReignTweak** is a runtime tool that allows you to:
-  **Patch the framerate**
-  **Apply ultrawide tweaks**

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> - Works **ONLY** on Proton/Wine due to how EAC is implemented on Linux.  
> - As of **27-07-2025**, it is **CURRENTLY online safe**. 
> - Main cpp code is currently not provided as it might enable cheating.
